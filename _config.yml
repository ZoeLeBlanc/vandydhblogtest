# Welcome to Jekyll!


# In addition to these settings, there is a file _data/tokens-template.yml
# that you'll want to customize for your site. It's named 'tokens' because
# that was it's original purpose, but because tokens.yml is .gitexcluded, it's
# a good place to store your site-specific data that you'd rather not have
# forked or cloned. Of course, that means you'd want to back it up elsewhere.

# Also, for your post bylines, add author info for yourself in `_data/authors.yml`.
# (Using that method instead of site.owner, in case your posts get cloned with your repo.)

  text: Thanks for dropping by. I hope that it will not waste your time, but in case
    it does, at least I tried. Originally from New Delhi, India, I’m doing my B.Tech
    in Computer Science from GGSIP University. But, apart from that, I’m a die hard
    classic rock fan, coffee addict, who also enjoy messing with hardware, playing
    football and Lawn Tennis. In general, my mind can zone out during any form of
    creative act. Opinions expressed here are mine.
